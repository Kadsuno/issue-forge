### Fixed

- **Skeleton Loaders CLS Issue**: Fixed Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) caused by `rand()` in skeleton components
    - Replaced random dimensions with fixed, predictable Tailwind utility classes
    - skeleton-card: Now uses fixed `h-20` instead of `rand(60, 100)px`
    - skeleton-list: Uses cycling array of widths (`w-3/4`, `w-4/5`, `w-5/6`) instead of `rand(60, 90)%`
    - skeleton-table: Uses predictable width arrays for headers and cells instead of `rand()` values
    - Eliminates layout shift on each render, improving Core Web Vitals scores
    - Provides consistent, professional appearance across all page loads
    - Uses Tailwind classes instead of inline styles for better performance
    - Updated documentation with CLS prevention best practices

- Noise texture has 0.03 opacity for subtle grain effect
- Parallax elements use data attributes for speed configuration
- Ripple effects auto-cleanup after 600ms
- Skeleton loaders auto-hide 500ms after content loads
- Scroll progress uses `scaleX` for performant animation

    - Updated `config/mail.php` to remove deprecated `scheme` parameter and add `verify_peer` security setting
    - Added Brevo API configuration to `config/services.php` for optional HTTP API fallback
    - Added comprehensive email configuration feature tests covering SMTP settings, notifications, and environment checks
    - Environment variable support for MAIL_EHLO_DOMAIN and MAIL_VERIFY_PEER

### Changed

- Enhanced SMTP mailer configuration with explicit `encryption` parameter and SSL verification
